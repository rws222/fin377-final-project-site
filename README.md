# Final Project Website

This is a rough example of how our website may look. We will likely use this template or something similar for our final project. The pictures in the folder called "rough_design_sketch" show our initial rough plan drawn on paper. At a minimum, they show what kinid of sections we are planning to include, and the rough structure of our final project. The site will be built using HTML, but the functionality of the project will be built with a jupyterlab notebook. This notebook will then be converted into HTML, and inserted into the website.

## Viewing the website (only for the final proposal)

To view the website, clone the repo, and open index.html in a browser. After the final proposal deadline, we will publish the site using GitHub Pages in this repo.
